To Do List bugs:
    1. Task count starts from 0
        1.1. Count number can be less than 0 (-1) when ALL tasks are marked
    2. The button near the search bar (which suppose to mark and remove marks from all the tasks) is removing marks only after two clicks instead of one
    3. Tasks are marked only by clicking on "check" circle. (Should be checked when clicking on task text)
    4. Editing long messages is not comfortable. The text shouldn't be compressed into 1 line
    5. If there are more than 1 task, text "x item left" should change into "x items left" because of plural
    6. Task text doesn't show multiple spaces, they appear only in edit mode  
    7. Completed tasks shouldn't be editable
    8. Clear button should have "Clear Completed" to be more "User Friendly"
    9. Button's "active" text should start with a capital letter
